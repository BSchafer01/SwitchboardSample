# SwitchboardSample
Sample application to demonstrate a recursive looping logic
 
This app was built with Blazor Webassembly to solve the following thought problem:

You are presented with a non-jagged 2D array of trues and falses. 
How would you program an algorithm to cycle through the array of lights and toggle any true that does not have a continuous route to the perimeter of the array.
